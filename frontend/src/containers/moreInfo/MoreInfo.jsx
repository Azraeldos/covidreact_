        <p>To protect yourself and others from Covid-19 individuals are recommended to wear a mask in public to protect from infected droplets and reduce spread.

        <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
        <p>
          Covid-19 primarily spreads through infected droplets transmitted through the 
          air and surfaces. A common way Covid-19 transmits is through contaminated public 
          surfaces such as handrails, door handles, and even handshakes. When individuals 
          do not wear masks in public they increase their likelihood of exposure through 
          infected droplets produced by infected individuals.
