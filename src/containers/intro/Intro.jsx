        <h1>How does age affect you?</h1>
        <p>Age plays a key role in the human body's response to Covid-19.
           Elderly individuals are the more susceptible to death caused Covid-19 due to having a weaker immune system.
            While younger individuals are more likely to survive they are just as susceptible to death due how quickly 
            Covid-19 attacks the immune system.</p>

      <div class = "column">
      <img src={logo2} alt="Monthly" />
      <h1>What is an R value?</h1>
      <p>R value stands for Reproduction and it is in relation to how fast something spreads. In this example the R value is being measured to help predict how contagious Covid-19 has been. When the R value reaches 1.00 then an outbreak has occurred meaning the amount of cases of Covid-19 are exponential in the area. </p>

      <h1>Confirmed cases of Covid-19 - September/October</h1>
      <p>Keeping track of Covid-19 cases in your area allows you to be more prepared for any possible outbreaks.
         The line chart above shows the number of positive Covid-19 cases in the San Bernardino area. 
         While positive cases of Covid-19 may be low it is important to remember that the R value plays a key role
          in determining how fast an outbreak can occur.</p>
